# NTYouTube #

I have no idea what this does. I just typed random characters into TextMate for a few minutes. It wasn't a `million-monkeys / million-typewriters / million-years` type of situation -- more like a `me / a Mac / about an hour` situation.

Apparently, if you add "nt" to the start of a YouTube video URL, you'll get an HTML5 version. I don't know.
